<h4 align="center">This branch is dedicated to completely re-writing the code for XX STARLiGHT -twopointzero-</h4>

## Branch Focus: ##
The current release version of STARLiGHT -twopointzero-, while much improved from V1, still has many faults due to bad code practices and old techniques. Rather than potentially break the mainline, we've made a new branch to allow for the entire theme to be re-worked from the ground up without affecting the mainline version.

The plan is to completely throw out almost all code and re-write it from scratch so everything is up-to-date. This includes replacing engine-generated elements as much as possible. No more engine wheel, etc. The main focus is to target performance while also adding QoL features as we see fit.

You are free to help us out by forking and submitting Pull Requests when you've re-implemented anything.
